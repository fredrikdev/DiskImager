DiskImager 1.1 Copyright (c) by Port Jackson Computing
FULL SOURCE RELEASE

License Agreement
=================
This source code is provided "as-is", it's completely unsupported, -and is used on your own risk. In other words, don't blame me if you screw up your computer.

What is this?
=================
It's a tiny MS-DOS based application, that creates images out of your floppy disks, so that you may later restore them, or send them to a friend.

DiskImager was released 1999 to the public. It was created in Turbo Pascal 6 and Inline 286 Assembler. This distribution includes full sourcecode of the DiskImager 1.1. It's fairly commented, and I've added comments to clarify further.

The source is provided for inspiration, and not for continued development of DiskImager.

May I...?
=================
Yes. You may use the sourcecode however you may see fit. 
No. You must not release a clone of DiskImager using this source. 

What now?
=================
Get a Turbo Pascal compiler (I think that there's still some free compilers on the internet). Load up the source, and start debugging. 


Have Fun!
