# DiskImager 1.1 

## Introduction
DiskImager is a tiny (6 KB) MS-DOS application that create image files out of floppy disks, so that you may later restore them or send them to a friend.

This source was originally released 1999 to the public. It was created in Turbo Pascal 6 and inline 286 Assembler. It is provided for inspiration, and not for continued development of DiskImager.

## What now?
Get a Turbo Pascal compiler (I think that there's still some free compilers on the internet). Load up the source, and start debugging.
